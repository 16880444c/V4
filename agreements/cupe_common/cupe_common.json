The Institutions have a responsibility under the BC's Human Rights Code to prevent harassment and to provide procedures to handle complaints, to resolve problems and to remedy situations where harassment occurs. The employer will offer educational and training programs designed to prevent harassment and to support the administration of the institutional policies and to ensure that all members of the institutional community are aware of their responsibility with respect to the policy. The Unions and Employers agree that attendance is required and will take place during compensated work time."
